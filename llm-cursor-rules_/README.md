# LLM Cursor Rules

Welcome to my repository of go-to rules for using Cursor and LLMs in software development!

## About

This repository contains my opinionated rules and best practices for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Cursor editor in software development workflows. The rules are designed to enhance productivity and code quality when working with AI-assisted coding tools.

## Rules

Currently, the repository includes two sets of rules:

1. Swift and SwiftUI Development Rules
2. Next.js 14 Development Rules

These rules cover best practices, code structure, state management, performance optimization, and more for their respective domains.

## Usage

Feel free to use these rules in your own projects or as a starting point for developing your own set of best practices. If you find them helpful, I'd appreciate attribution (see below).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or additional rules, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
